# Quiz App Readme

This is a small project utilizing React.js, React Bootstrap v1.6.1, Bootstrap v4.6.0, Sass, Axios, and Open Trivia Database API. 

The idea for this project was more to work on logic and coding than appearance, though I find myself unable to create anything without a little bit of styling so I used Bootstrap so some simple styling. I also used Sass to create a custom app theme for Bootstrap.
